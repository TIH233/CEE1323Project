This is the course project for course "CEE1323: Practical Data Science and Machine Learning" in Spring 2024

Raw dataset us from Kaggle and database is in form of excel -- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undersc0re/flight-delay-and-causes
R is used for data preprocessing
MATLAB is used for model trainig, testing and validation
some sofwares are used for EA and MEP, GEP

primary work focusing on data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature selection and engineering (which mostly refer to field expertise), data normalizing and encoding
Together with testing and analyzing to help with feature selection (due to the large scale of dataset)

The final result turns out to be irrational (can be seen in the screenshots that there is no error in all training, testing, validation sets, with all models/ techniques)
Since all three sets were originally randomly sampled, the preprocessing methods, while the dataset is clainmed by the authors that it was originated from public dataset, 
1. classify into heavy delay& not heavy delay rather than whether delay or not
2. categorization and feature engineering
3. the dataset is actually biased
might be the reason

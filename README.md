This is the course project for course "CEE1323: Practical Data Science and Machine Learning"

Raw dataset us from Kaggle and database is in form of excel
R is used for data preprocessing
MATLAB is used for model trainig, testing and validation
some sofwares are used for EA and MEP, GEP

primary work focusing on data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature selection and engineering (which mostly refer to field expertise), data normalizing and encoding
Together with testing and analyzing to help with feature selection (due to the large scale of dataset)
